# joinextensions-leftjoin
Very simple LeftOuterJoin extension methods for both IQueryable and IEnumerable types.

In linq, if you need a left outer join, you have to use GroupJoin/Selectmany/DefaultIfEmpty blocks. There is another package in nuget containing similar extensions for only IEnumerable, which results in performance loss for database queries. For this need, I developed IQueryable versions.
